# Lean Primer

Lean thinking is a system for product development and production which has been successfully used by companies like Toyota.'Continuous improvement' and 'respect for people' are the two core pillars of a 'lean thinking house'. At the bottom you have the foundation and the goal sits at the top.

'Continuous improvement' includes processes that aim to make systems better over time. The Japanese practice and mindset of 'Kaizen' is roughly translated to 'Continuous Improvement' but as a mindset it means “My work is
to do my work and to improve my work” and “continuously improve for its own sake.”
All processes must be subject to small and incremental improvements. This also requires making standards less rigid to allow for this change.
'Value' and 'Waste' are two concepts which help facilitate incremental improvement. 'Value' is anything that contributes to the value that the customer can perceive in your product. 'Waste' is basically everything that does not add value but consumes resources. A good path to improvement is banishing waste.

'Respect for people' aims to improve relationships and trust amongst team members. Lean acknowledges the intellect of 'ordinary' employees and aims to harness it by building an environment where all employees can contribute. Respect allows lean to utilize the full potential of its employees.
This respect also extends to the customer. Lean aims to avoid 'troubling the customer' by not making them wait and not delivering defective products, among other things.
